These experts can provide insights into the potential benefits and challenges of self-driving vehicles. They can also suggest ways to mitigate the negative consequences for the affected industries and help Joe make informed decisions about the development and implementation of self-driving cars and trucks.

    Public opinion and feedback: To gauge public sentiment and concerns, Joe should engage with the public through surveys, public forums, and town hall meetings. This will allow him to understand the expectations and anxieties of the citizens regarding the introduction of self-driving vehicles. He should consider their feedback and incorporate it into his decision-making process.

By applying this strategy, Joe will gain a comprehensive understanding of the issue. He will have a clear overview of the potential benefits and challenges associated with self-driving cars and trucks, as well as insights into the concerns and expectations of the stakeholders and the general public. This information will enable him to formulate effective solutions that balance the advantages of automation with the needs and well-being of his nation's workforce and citizens.
